## Questions or Observations

1. Does it still hold true that “an artist's first and spontaneous thoughts are most valuable because they are closest to the original creative spark?” I feel that, at least in the digital age, we are encouraged to refine work as much as possible before considering it done. Does this refinement result in a loss of value? 

2. How does variation in coloring affect the way that you perceive the versions of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell? Do some versions feel higher quality or even more modern as a result of the richer coloring? Copies B and H stand out to me in particular, as they are so starkly different in terms of saturation and detail. 

3. In _The Book_ we read about a number of different forms that artists have made books into. Though we've discussed that the term "book" encompasses much more than a bound codex, where do we draw the line at what can be considered a "book"? If you can't actually decipher any text or information at all, is it still a book? Dieter Roth's _Literaturwurst_ comes to mind here. How can we define the ends of the "book" spectrum?

This is more of an aside than anything, but there's a doom metal band called Earth that has an album called _Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method_ in reference to both Cormac McCarthy and Blake’s _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_. As this is an instrumental album, the title is the only direct reference that they make to this text, but the band stated that each song has an individual arc that contributes to the overall arc of the album, rather than just being a random collection of songs. This made me think about how the pages of Blake's text each stand alone as works of art, as the imagery and text work together to create an immersive experience.
