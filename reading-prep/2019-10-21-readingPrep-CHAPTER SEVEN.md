# Reading Prep: Chapter 7 - FORMAT

#### Anna Smith

## Questions or Observations

1. Given that this chapter is titled "Format," the "Baxter's Procrustes" piece was really fascinating as it pitted form against content in terms of which is the most important aspect of a book. No one on the reviewing committee wants to tarnish their own copy by cutting it, so they instead spitball about general ideas they've heard Baxter discuss in the past, and effectively make up the content of the book. Baxter smirks in the background, and they later discover that the beautifully bound book is blank. Rather than rendering the book worthless, its value skyrockets because :
 > The smaller the edition, the greater the collector’s eagerness to acquire a copy. There are but six uncut copies left, I am told, of the Procrustes, and three sealed copies, of one of which I am the fortunate possessor.”

 In this instance, form trumps content. Where else do we see this phenomenon occur in our world today?

2. Leah Price's chapter "Interleaf: Please Lay Flat" really messed with my head. When I realized what was going on with the chapter, I told myself that it would be easy to get the hang of: just read all the way across the spread instead of reading down a single page. No matter how hard I tried to simplify this, though, I still found myself skipping lines and losing my place on the page. It was also interesting that she was writing about reading standing up versus sitting down, because I had attempted to read this at the gym, so I was actually reading standing up with propped on the machine. This made it even more challenging to contend with the setup of the text, though, as I wasn't only reading an unfamiliarly formatted page, but I was reading it from an unfamiliar vantage point. With this in mind, how do our socially dictated reading habits affect the ways that we view reading as a practice?  

3. With _Pride and Prejudice_ being set on the monumentally successful pedestal that it's on today, reading about Austen's thoughts during its production is really interesting. I was particularly struck by her self-consciousness about book length, when she states that "The second volume is shorter than I could wish, but the difference is not so much in reality as in look, there being a larger proportion of narrative in that part." This makes me think about the Chestnutt piece which stresses a concern for the external appearance of books (and we can infer that longer tomes likely looked better on a bookshelf) while Price dives into society's rejection of hefty codices. Our relationship with printed and bound books has undeniably changed over time, and unpacking the reasons why can yield interesting findings about our society as a whole.
