## Questions or Observations

1. The idea that without big data “it is difficult to distinguish between personal experience and collective oppression” has significant implications, especially in the age of the internet. So often I feel like there's a brief questionnaire or a coupe of personal questions that you have to answer in order to enter a particular site or program. Though these questions may seem trivial, it's really impossible to say how far-reaching the effects of these simple check boxes are. Is it possible that simple profiling and targeted ads affect each person's experience with the digital world so much that the way that they interact with the Internet is affected in a sort of cyclical manner?

2. The shaky notion of authorship of fugitive verses reminds me of movies that are "based on a true story." Seeing that attribution gives even the cheesiest of horror flicks a much weightier sense of importance, just as seeing a "deathbed composition by Charles Dickens" in a magazine would make that poem stand out among others. How does an attribution (even a false attribution) change the way you perceive a story (or movie)? How is this especially tricky to navigate in today's digital climate, where information is constantly being published, republished, and distributed in non-native forms with or without credit to the author?
3. One of the additional poems that I looked at was "Advantage of Taking a Newspaper" which is, quite blatantly, an advertisement. Though the author is unknown, the Boston Transcript wrote that 
>"The following exhibits the genius and talent of a true poet, of one who is destined to render himself immortal by his inspirations. There is a moral to it, an inspiration, which should stir up the soul of very liberal minded and intelligent beings."

A lack of concrete authorship isn't good or bad necessarily, but it can definitely mean that the distributor of the poem is free to use the poem the enact whatever (potentially ulterior) motives they may have. Calling the author a "genius" suggests that buying a newspaper is a "genius" act, so this poem not only functions as entertainment but as advertisement (which isn't bad, per se, but definitely crafty).
