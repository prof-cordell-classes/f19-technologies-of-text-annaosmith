# Lab Report: Into the Archive

#### Anna Smith

## Process Description

This lab took place in two parts: first we explored the Northeastern Archives, and then we visited the archives of the Massachusetts Historical Society. At the Northeastern archives, we viewed a number of older texts, and then shifted our attention toward the archives' collection of modern artist books. At the Massachusetts Historical Society, we toured the facilites and then saw a selection of artifacts, ranging from children's books to a map of Boston. 

## Observations

I've visited the Northeastern archives a number of times (including a couple times this semester) so I was familiar with some of the texts that we viewed, but it's always interesting to interact with these pieces and see what can be uncovered in the span of a class period. This time around, I particularly enjoyed the discussion that we had on the different uses and purposes of the texts. I feel that in other classes, I've tended to observe these texts and minimally conjecture as to why they might be that way, but the background that we've established throughout this semester gave me a different lens through which to view the artifacts. It was interesting to note which books were originals and which were facsimiles, produced to mimic certain stylistic choices without a sense of function. One book stood out to me in particular, as it was fairly large but left a lot of white space on the page. This likely would not have been the case in an authentic version, as page space was valuable, but this volume nodded to traditional methods while using more modern techniques.

Moving forward a few centuries, I was truly surprised to see the collection of modern artist books that Northeastern has ammassed, partly because I had never seen any of them before. It was really exciting to interact with these pieces after having read about a number of different artist books. I've become more and more fascinated with the idea of what a "book" actually _is_, and I loved that so many of these pieces challenge our traditional standards of books. Some pieces challenged this notion more than others, such as the match "book" and the round book that was bound on all sides, while others stuck to more traditional formats but challenged traditions with their content. These pieces really sparked creativity in me, and I've since had a ton of ideas for my next unessay and maybe even a project just for fun when I have some free time. 

Shifting to the Massachusetts Historical Society, I have to admit that I was a bit frustrated that we weren't able to interact with the texts. I absolutely understand why this was the case, as we were a gaggle of strangers who they have no reason to believe can be held responsible for valuable texts. Having just visited the Northeastern archives, though, I really wanted to at least flip a few pages (gently of course) to better understand the texts we were looking at. Moving past that though, I was really interested in the variety of texts that we looked at. There was a young girl's diary, a handwritten story, children's etiquette books, a propagana piece, and even a printed map. Looking at all of these artifacts side by side, assumptions could be drawn about various time periods and cultures just from these small snapshots. 

## Analysis

At both archives, we looked at so many different texts with different purposes and formats, and I couldn't help thinking back to Bonnie Mak's piece about "How the Page Matters." She describes the page as "a careful integration of physical and cognitive architectures" (Mak 18) which I felt was consistent with many of the pieces that we looked at.I found her comments on the nuances of typeface to be particularly interesting, as we saw a number of different fonts displayed. The Dragon Prayer Book utilized a tight scriptorial hand, giving it a distinct feel compared to another book we looked at that was set in blackletter. At the Historical Society, we saw a primer intended to teach Native Americans about Christianity that featured a font created for this Native American language. A piece created to quash a culture simultaneously and creates a perverse bridge between this marginalized group and the world of print.

I was also interested in the use of imagery that we encountered in the various texts. Certain texts included the occasional map or woodcut portrait, while others used imagery to make more of a point. Mak dives into this notion, stating that "The placement of images on the page, for example, is a sign from designers about the value of the illustrations and how they are meant to be read" (17). As a designer, I've definitely been in a situation where I have to grapple with text and image and make conscious decisions about how the reader is supposed to interact with the imagery. Is it meant to complement the text or supercede it? We saw instances of both in the archives; two examples that come to mind are Sarah Putnam's diary and the Mother Goose rebus book. The diary made use of illustrations in a supplemental way, as they were intended to elaborate her thoughts and experiences.

The rebus, on the other hand, utilized imagery in a different way, replacing entire words with images. The story could be read seamlessly in this manner, as long as you were familiar with the objects portrayed. The images weren't necessarily there to be examined as standalone pieces or art, but rather functioned more as symbols.

Revisiting the primer that I mentioned previously, this was an interesting piece to view after reading Ellen Cushman's commentary on the Cherokee syllabary. From our vantage point in history and society, we're accustomed to associating literacy with modernity and civilization. Cushman reflects on this association, explaining that "the public celebrated the invention with amazement that an Indian, without an understanding of English literacy, could create a writing system that would bring the Cherokees out of their savage ways into civilization" (Cushman 68). The primer, therefore, is a particularly interesting artifact. It represents an attempt to "civilize" a group of people by instructing them on the Christian religion, but gives the group credit insofar as they are at least "civilized" enough to be addressed in their own written language. Cushman goes on to note that "Any act of speak- ing, reading, or writing in a Native language contributes in small or great measure to a tribe’s continued existence" (70). This text was ultimately created to prompt religious conversion, but it walks a surprising line in terms of respecting the tribe's existing language. 

Finally, James Gleick's "Two Wordbooks" was extremely helpful in grounding our archival explorations in the knowledge that written language as we know it is far from a longstanding tradition. It has only (fairly) recently been standardized, and this is definitely something we encountered in the archives. Gleick states that just a few centuries ago "no one agreed on the spelling of most names: they were spoken, seldom written. In fact, few had any concept of “spelling”—the idea that each word, when written, should take a particular predetermined form of letters" (Gleick 5). He describes this as "information poverty," though people in this time period had no way of recognizing it. In the older texts that we explored, there were instances where, though something was technically in English, it was very hard for the modern reader to decipher. Shorthands, variant spellings, words that have fallen out of use, and the infamous long "s" are some examples of these frustrating obstacles. Though this can make it tricky at times to decipher these texts, it is not a phenomenon that is unique to the past. Even today in the age of the Oxford English Dictionary, the meanings that we take for granted one day are subject to change the next. Gleick talks about the unreliable relativity of verbs, stating that "these words are hourly shifting their relations, and can no more be ascertained in a dictionary, than a grove, in the agitation of a storm, can be accurately delineated from its picture in the water" (25). It is likely that a century or two from now, people will struggle to suss meaning out of texts that we read freely today. The experience we had in the archives is something that people will undoubtedly continue to encounter in the future, perhaps even more so with the abundance of textual information that comes along with the Internet.
